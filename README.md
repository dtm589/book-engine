# Book Search Engine

## Description
This project uses a Google Books API to create a searh engine for books. You can also create a login to save books to your own personal list. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. I utilized GraphQL API built with Apollo Server for this project instead of RESTful API.
